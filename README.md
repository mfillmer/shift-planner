## Technical Details

When starting this project, I sketched out the main logic as a diagram and saved it in [./docs/logic/scheduling.md](./docs/logic/scheduling.md). You can have a look at it to get a general understanding of the scheduling mechanism, but please note that the code may have evolved further and the documentation might be out of date.

This algorihtm is also a first, naive approach and might change completely in the future.
